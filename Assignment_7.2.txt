b. What is the difference between co-variance and correlation? Take an example from this dataset and show the differences if any?


Covariance and Correlation are two mathematical concepts which are quite commonly used in business statistics. Both of these two determine the relationship and measures the dependency between two random variables. Despite, some similarities between these two mathematical terms, they are different from each other. Correlation is when the change in one item may result in the change in another item.

Correlation is considered as the best tool for for measuring and expressing the quantitative relationship between two variables in formula. On the other hand, covariance is when two items vary together. 

        BASIS FOR COMPARISON	       COVARIANCE	            CORRELATION


             Meaning	        Covariance is a measure         Correlation is a statistical 
                              indicating the extent to          measure that indicates how
                               which two random variables        strongly two variables
                                 change in tandem.	                 are related.
 

             What is it?	Measure of correlation	       Scaled version of covariance


               Values	        Lie between -8 and +8	       Lie between -1 and +1


          Change in scale	Affects covariance	       Does not affects correlation


          Unit free measure	         No	                     Yes

                                                 Cov(X,Y)
    Covariance vs. Correlation           ?(X,Y)= ________
                                                 sX  sY 

             Where:

                   ?(X,Y) – the correlation between the variables X and Y
                   Cov(X,Y) – the covariance between the variables X and Y
                   sX – the standard deviation of the X-variable
                   sY – the standard deviation of the Y-variable

Both measures only linear relationship between two variables, i.e. when the correlation coefficient is zero, covariance is also zero. Further, the two measures are unaffected by the change in location.

Correlation is a special case of covariance which can be obtained when the data is standardized. Now, when it comes to making a choice, which is a better measure of the relationship between two variables, correlation is preferred over covariance, because it remains unaffected by the change in location and scale, and can also be used to make a comparison between two pairs of variables.

Take an example from this dataset and show the differences if any?
